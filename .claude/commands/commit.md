description: Git差分を分析して適切な粒度でコミットを作成（AIが質問してWhyを引き出す）
---

## Execution Steps

1. Analyze changes with `git status` and `git diff`
2. Report any potential issues or concerns in the diff and do not commit
3. Group commits based on the following criteria:
   - 1 commit = 1 logical change
   - Dependent changes in the same commit
4. **Stage changes with appropriate granularity (`git add`)**
5. **Ask the user questions about the staged changes to understand Why (reason for the change)**
   - When asking questions, display the current question number and total number of questions like "Question 1 / 3"
   - Example: "Question 1 / 3: Why did you split this test?"
   - Example: "Question 2 / 3: What was the background for refactoring this function?"
6. **Continue asking questions until all doubts are resolved**
7. **Complete the commit message based on the answers and execute the commit**
8. **If there are remaining unstaged changes, return to step 4**
